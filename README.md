## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Node.js (LTS version recommended) installed on your system.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository (or create the files manually):**

    If you're cloning, use:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd modern-chakra-dashboard
    ```

    If you've downloaded the files, navigate to the project directory.

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```

### Running the Development Server

To start the development server, run:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

This will typically start the application at `http://localhost:5173` (or another available port). The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Building for Production

To create a production-ready build of the application, run:

```bash
npm run build
# or
yarn build
```

This command will compile the application into the `dist` directory, ready for deployment.

### Previewing the Production Build

After building, you can preview the production build locally:

```bash
npm run preview
# or
yarn preview
```

This will serve the `dist` directory, allowing you to test the optimized production version.
